#### :computer: About me
I'm an aspiring full stack developer and undergraduate student at Penn State. I was adopted by the programming community 6 years ago after spending ~~some~~ a lot of time studying Java. Now, I'm working on a series of plugins for the Microsoft Office platforms. They are designed to teach users basic computer literacy skills and how to use each platform.
